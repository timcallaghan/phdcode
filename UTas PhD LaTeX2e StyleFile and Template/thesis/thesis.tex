% thesis.tex (starting point of a UTas mathematics thesis)

% Note that the following defaults are also contained in the 'report' class
% (this is not exhaustive...see appropriate references for all options)
% 'oneside' mode...overide with 'twoside' to force output for two-sided printing.
% 'final' mode...overide with 'draft' to see linebreak malfunctioning.
% For example, to use two-sided printing one would declare the 'documentclass'
% as follows...
% '\documentclass[11pt,a4paper,twoside]{report}'
%
% Specific Mathematical options are as follows
% 'leqno' to force equation numbering on the left side of the page.
% 'fleqn' to force formulas to flush left (centered is the default).
% If 'fleqn' is specified then the left indent is controlled with '\mathindent'.
% i.e. '\setlength{\mathindent}{2.5cm}'

% Declare overall type of document (use 11pt report class on A4 paper).
\documentclass[11pt,a4paper]{report}

% If you want to generate an index you should include the following command
% which puts a makeindex command in the preamble. Additionally, you need to un-comment
% the file 'index' in the '\includeonly' command below and also include the 'index'
% file in the main document.
\makeindex

% Include the style file which contains all the required formatting
% information that is set out in the Research Higher Degrees Resource
% Handbook (2003 version). NOTE: This file uses the following packages
% 'graphicx' for graphics manipulation
% 'fancyhdr' for nice headers and footers.
% 'makeidx' for generating the index
% 'tocbibind' for adding table of contents entries for bibliography, index etc.
% 'sectsty' for generating stylised chapter and section headings.
% You will need to make sure your LaTeX installation has these packages
% installed...else it wont work :(
\usepackage{mathphdthesis}

% Here you would include any additional packages that you want to use.
% You should make sure they don't clash with the above packages that
% are in use in the style file.

% Specify which pieces (other .tex files) you plan to include. You can comment
% out files that you will include later or have already finished to speed
% up TeX processing
\includeonly{
prelude % Contains all the relevant candidate information (name, degrees, abstract etc)
,newcom % Place all you new commands in here
,chap1  % The first chapter
,chap2  % The second chapter
,chap3  % The third chapter
,chap4  % The fourth chapter
,app0   % Needed to switch to appendix mode
,app1   % The first appendix
,app2   % The second appendix
,biby   % Makes the bibliography from the BibTeX database
,index  % Places the index in the thesis
